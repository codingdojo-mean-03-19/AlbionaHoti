Real-Time Colors

1. Create a socket application that presents the user with 3 buttons for color options.

2. When a user clicks on one of the options, all currently connected socket users should
have their background change to that color.

3. BONUS: As soon as a new user connects to our server, update their color with the most
recent color previously selected by the last user.


1) Create the three buttons - view
2) Each button should have a form - which is connected with jquery
 to send data about that particular color user selects
