1) Create the client view - add the form
2) use jquery to save the users input and emit it as 'a_new_user' and send data: name
3) Have the server listen to 'a_new_user' event and trigger that event

  3.1) - Have the server listen an event called 'new_user' with data:name

  3.2) - We store the name of the new user in a variable/array/hash - called users
         and will use this 'users' in the chat room somehow
  
   Have the server broadcast an event called 'new_user' together with the data: name - to the clients

    Since we are building a chat room - we don't need to broadcast the list of the 'new_user' - we only 
    need to save them somewhere - so we know that particular user has been registered - and redirect them
    to the chatroom

  3.3) - Redirect(jquery - show/hide chatroom) the registered users to another page - chatroom
